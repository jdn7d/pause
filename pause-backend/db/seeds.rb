   And out through your mouth/1/2/3/4/As you inhale, imagine that you are breathing in calmness/
   As you exhale, imagine that you are breathing out your anxiety/Inhale peace and clarity/
   Exhale stress and worry/Inhale/Feel your anxiety slip away with each exhale/Inhale/Exhale/Your mind may drift to feelings of worry/
   This is okay, be mindful/Without judgment, gently bring your attention back to the breath/
   Notice how calm you feel as you sit and breathe"},
